Compare Amazon Go and Sam's club Now, Amazon Go stores utilize a combination of sensors on the shelves, cameras and computer vision with machine learning.Different from Amazon Go, Sam's Club Now pay more attention on camera layout to plan shopping routes, and it use RFID\cite{1192765}.In our experiment, we get their merits, we set camera layout first, then use computer vision and sensors to identity items category and quantity.

\subsection{Computer vision}
Two of the most popular computer vision are YOLO and Faster-RCNN. The both have strong recognition ability. Faster-RCNN is a technology for using CNN to research feature map, and use RPN network to do full join operation for this, then send it to box regression layer and taxonomy\cite{NIPS2015_5638}. YOLO input SÃ—S grid, and every gird is responsible for the objects falling into it, then it can choose the maximal IOU of bounding box\cite{yolov3}. We choose YOLOv3 for our experiment, because in processing medium-scale and small-scale da
