The concept of "cashier-free supermarket" was emerging recently.
This work aims to simulate a completely virtual supermarket by the Unity3D.
In the meantime, an item identification system underlying multi camera layout and weight sensor
is embedded in our simulator. YOLOv3 is employed for the item recognition algorithm.
%The item recognition algorithm is base on YOLOv3, and recognition processing by image which get form multi cameras.
%From the simulator scene, it can be used in real supermarket.
%This experiment can be used as a reference for the "cashier-free supermarket".
By a series of comprehensive experiments, we have corroborated that the prototype simulator is capable of conveying a concept of real cashier-free supermarket.
